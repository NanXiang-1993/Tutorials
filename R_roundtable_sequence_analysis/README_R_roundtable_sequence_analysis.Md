This directory contains R scripts for the analysis of 16S amplicon data that were presented at the R roundtable at the ZMT on 21.1.2016.
The analyses covered in the tutorial are:

* Importing data in R (read.table() arguments, basic data and object types in R)

* Alpha diversity calculation and plotting (Hill numbers, rarefaction curves)

* Beta diversity and ordination plots

* Differential OTU abundance using [ALDEx2](https://github.com/pbuttigieg/aphros/wiki/Compositionality-of-sequencing-data) and modified functions to work with multifactorial GLMs and GLMMs

* Estimating community function using [Tax4Fun](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25957349)

More R scripts on plotting sequence data are available [here](https://github.com/chassenr/NGS/tree/master/Plotting).
